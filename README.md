# 📊 Advanced Subscription & Pricing Analysis (SQL)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on auditing subscription plans and identifying growth opportunities for a SaaS business. Using **Advanced SQL**, I analyzed user behavior, revenue leakage, and retention trends to provide data-driven pricing recommendations.

---

## 🚀 Key Business Questions Addressed
* **Revenue Growth:** What is the Month-over-Month (MoM) growth trend?
* **Churn Analysis:** Which subscription tiers are at "High Risk" of churn?
* **Unit Economics:** What is the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) across different plans?
* **Data Integrity:** Identifying inconsistencies in billing and revenue reporting.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Stack & SQL Techniques Used
* **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** For modular and readable complex queries.
* **Window Functions (`LAG`, `OVER`):** To calculate MoM growth and trend analysis.
* **Conditional Aggregates (`CASE WHEN`):** For segmenting churn risk and user tiers.
* **Data Cleaning:** Handling NULL values and formatting dates for time-series analysis.

## 📈 Sample Insights & Recommendations
* **Insight:** The 'Basic' plan showed a 20% higher churn rate compared to 'Premium'.
* **Recommendation:** Suggested a 10% loyalty discount for annual Basic plan renewals to improve retention.
* **Impact:** Identified a potential **15% revenue leakage** due to inconsistent billing cycles.
